We, [Timble](http://www.timble.net), are a team building an **open government platform** for the internet websites of the [Belgian Local Police](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_Belgium#Local_Police).

You might be aware that we do business a bit differently from most typical government IT contractors. We'd like to take a second to explain what that means and why it matters.

## Task

Creation of a uniform and self manageable internet platform for all Belgian Local Police zones to allow each individual Police zone to manage their own content.

We provide functional and technical analysis, technical and strategic development, research, design, support and training services. A brief overview:

* **Development** of a multi-site and multi-lingual application to help optimise the extensibility, security and maintenance of the website of a Local Police zone.
* **Design** of a uniform look and feel using common graphical elements which works on any device (desktop, tablet and phone) using existing accessibility standards.
* Daily operation of an online private **support** system for 350 content editors to allow them to report problems and communicate with the development team.
* **Training** of content editors to allow them to manage the content of their website on the platform, including best practices on how to work with social media channels.

## Software as a Service (SaaS)

Software as a Service (SaaS) means that there's never any software to install, as everything runs on our servers. There are a multitude of benefits to this approach:

- SaaS is usually orders of magnitude less expensive orders of magnitude less expensive than traditional enterprise software
- There is no maintenance involved from the client's standpoint, and the software is always up-to-date
- New features are always being added, and existing ones are constantly being improved

## Strategy

The project aims to be a high level blueprint for the design of government and specifically Police web technology, based on modern, user focused and open source technologies and solutions. Solutions are build in a such a way they can be continually upgraded, changed and reintegrated to keep up with user needs.

To accomplish this, a choice is made to move away from big ready-made products and from outsourcing to large IT providers. Instead the architecture is build feature by feature, working from the start with a multidisciplinary technical and digital team and in direct connection with the platform stakeholders.

This is a new approach to technology architecture for the Belgian Local Police, and Belgian Government in general, which ensures that Police zones have a modern technical architecture needed to deliver great digital services.

## Methodology

The project is being developed and supported on a result basis using the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/):

* **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
* **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
* **Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

## Community

Alongside the actual development of the project, we also actively work to encourage this new approach to architecture across the Belgian Local Police zones.

One of the ways this is done is by building and maintaining an active and open community of developers. Anyone should be able to contribute to the architecture, both inside and outside of the Police boundaries.

All the source code for the project is hosted on a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/belgianpolice) which allows other developers to learn from, re-use and contribute to the development of the platform.
