We, [Timble](http://www.timble.net), are a team hired by the Belgian Police to built an **open government platform** for the internet websites of the [Belgian Local Police](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_Belgium#Local_Police).

## Task

Creation of a uniform and self manageable internet platform for all Belgian Local Police zones to allow each individual Police zone to manage their own content.

We provide functional and technical analysis, technical and strategic development, research, design, support and training services. A brief overview:

* **Development** of a multi-site and multi-lingual application to help optimise the extensibility, security and maintenance of the website of a Local Police zone.
* **Design** of a uniform look and feel using common graphical elements which works on any device (desktop, tablet and phone) using existing accessibility standards.
* Daily operation of an online private **support** system for 350 content editors to allow them to report problems and communicate with the development team.
* **Training** of content editors to allow them to manage the content of their website on the platform, including best practices on how to work with social media channels.

## Strategy

The project aims to be a high level blueprint for the design of government and specifically Police web technology, based on modern, user focused and open source technologies and solutions. Solutions are build in a such a way they can be continually upgraded, changed and reintegrated to keep up with user needs.

To accomplish this, a choice is made to move away from big ready-made products and from outsourcing to large IT providers. Instead the architecture is build feature by feature, working from the start with a multidisciplinary technical and digital team and in direct connection with the platform stakeholders.

This is a new approach to technology architecture for the Belgian Police which ensure that Police zones have a modern technical architecture needed to deliver great digital services.

## Methodology

The project is being developed and supported on a result basis using an [Agile iterative and incremental development methodology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development), with a focus on proof through doing and constant testing.

For example, if we want to define a way of storing distributed data safely, an initial version of a proposed data network is build to prove how it works quickly and cheaply. This gives an approach that works which can then be shared across services. New versions are continually improved each time they are reused, from project to project, service to service.

## Community

Alongside the actual development of the project, we also actively work to encourage this new approach to architecture across Belgian Police departments.

One of the ways this is done is by building and maintaining an active and open community of developers. Anyone should be able to contribute to the architecture, both inside and outside of the Police boundaries.

All the source code for the project is hosted on a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/belgianpolice) which allows other developers to learn from, re-use and contribute to the development of the platform.
