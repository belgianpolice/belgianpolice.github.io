## Banner starting point

When choosing a banner for your website try to capture the relationship between the police and the citizens (community). Almost every visitor reaches the website by either searching for “police town name” or by a social media channel they follow. So adding a local landmark will add close to no value for these visitors. It is also very hard to properly display a local landmark in the available space.

## Banner requirements

The image should be 900 pixels in width and 110 pixels in height. Do not add rounded corners, borders or shadows. The rounded corners and border will be added by the website.

Make sure the uncut image is large enough to be cut to 900x110 pixels. Also make sure the contrast between elements is high enough. But also try to avoid that shadows and highlights on people and objects are close to black and white.

**Do's**

1. Use a single image.
2. Try to capture the relation between the police and the citizens (community).
3. Try to focus on the subjects of the image by photographing them up close instead of far away.

**Don'ts**

1. Do not use a collection/collage of images.
2. Do not add extra text, badges, logos or other graphical elements to the image.
3. No images of “commissaries”. They should be placed with the contact information.
4. No police officers with sunglasses.
5. No images without policemen.

2. There are no citizens on this image.

## Social media

To make sure your social media channels are as recognizable as possible for your vistors you need good avatars. These avatars are quite often being used in smaller sizes then you upload them. For example on mobile phones.

**Avatars**

We suggest you use the images provided by us here below for the best result. Uploading an avatar with the district name on it is useless since the district name is already displayed next to the avatar or below it. Also those names could get very unrecognizable when displayed smaller. Uploading another logo then the official police logo will confuse visitors and also leave a less professional appearance.

<ul class="gallery" style="margin:0;">
<li class="gallery__item">
<a class="thumbnail" href="/images/documentation/police_avatar.jpg">
<img src="/images/documentation/police_avatar.jpg" />
</a>
</li>
</ul>

**Headers**

For the social media headers we suggest you use the same image as the one used for the banner on your website. This way if a visitor visits multiple channels during the week (twitter, facebook, website) they see a familiar style.

## The total image

As an example we included some screenshots of how the total online image looks for Leuven.
