## Banner starting point

When choosing a banner for your website try to capture the relationship between the police and the citizens (community). Almost every visitor reaches the website by either searching for “police town name” or by a social media channel they follow. So adding a local landmark will add close to no value for these visitors. It is also very hard to properly display a local landmark in the available space.

## Banner requirements

The image should be 900 pixels in width and 110 pixels in height. Do not add rounded corners, borders or shadows. The rounded corners and border will be added by the website.

Make sure the uncut image is large enough to be cut to 900x110 pixels. Also make sure the contrast between elements is high enough. But also try to avoid that shadows and highlights on people and objects are close to black and white.

**Do's**

1. Use a single image.
2. Try to capture the relation between the police and the citizens (community).
3. Try to focus on the subjects of the image by photographing them up close instead of far away.

**Don'ts**

1. Do not use a collection/collage of images.
2. Do not add extra text, badges, logos or other graphical elements to the image.
3. No images of “commissaries”. They should be placed with the contact information.
4. No police officers with sunglasses.
5. No images without policemen.
