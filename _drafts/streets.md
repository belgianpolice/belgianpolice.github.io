## Streets
We now update the streets in your website weekly, on wednesday evening, using the [CRAB database](https://www.agiv.be/producten/crab) provided by the [AGIV](https://www.agiv.be/).

Whenever a street is added or changed in the CRAB database these changes will be available in your site within a week.

You can verify if all your streets are attached to a district officer by navigating to 'Tools > Streets' in your administrator interface and  filter for 'Missing district officer'.

In the coming weeks we will get in touch with [GÃ©oportail de la Wallonie](http://geoportail.wallonie.be/) & [CIBG Brussels](http://www.cibg.irisnet.be/) if they can help us to further optimise our streets database.
