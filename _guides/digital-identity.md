These guidelines provide you with the design specification to customize the [banner](#website-banner) on your website and guidance to improve your digital identity across [social media](#social-media) channels.

## Photography

The goal is to create a picture focused on the relationship between the police and the citizens (community) that can be used on your website and social media channels.

**Do...**

1. Use a single picture.
2. Use a location that has enough depth.
3. Try to capture the relation between the police and the citizens (community).
4. Try to focus on the subjects but add enough surrounding width.

**Don't...**

1. Use a collection/collage of pictures.
2. Add extra text, badges, logos or other graphical elements to the picture.
3. Focus on landmarks (locations, buildings, ...), they can be added to the contact information.
4. Use people with sunglasses.

Once you have a good picture improvements can be applied ([image editing](http://www.linkyblog.com/basic-post-processing-image-editing-to-make-your-pics-great/)), see the before and after example:

<ul class="gallery" style="margin:0;">
<li class="gallery__item">
<a class="thumbnail" href="/images/documentation/branding-5388-original.jpg" data-gallery="enabled" title="Before editing">
<img src="/images/documentation/branding-5388-original.jpg" />
</a>
</li>
<li class="gallery__item">
<a class="thumbnail" href="/images/documentation/branding-5388-edited.jpg" data-gallery="enabled" title="After editing">
<img src="/images/documentation/branding-5388-edited.jpg" />
</a>
</li>
</ul>

Make sure the contrast between elements is high enough. But also try to avoid that shadows and highlights on people and objects are close to black and white.

## Website banner

### Requirements

The banner for your website should be 890 x 110 pixels. Do not add rounded corners, borders or shadows.

### Example

<a href="/images/documentation/branding-5388-banner.jpg" data-gallery="enabled">
![](/images/documentation/branding-5388-banner.jpg)
</a>

This banner is considered a very good banner for the following reasons:

1. It is a single image that really captures the relationship between the police and the community.
2. The image has a good depth with the focus on the main subjects.
3. The colors of the image fit the rest of the website very well.

## Social media

To make sure your social media channels are as recognizable as possible for your vistors you need good profile image (avatar).

### Profile image

We suggest you use the provided image (official logo) below for the best result, why?

1. Using a profile image with the zone name on it is useless since the zone name (account name) is already displayed close to the avatar.
2. Text will get unrecognizable on small screens.
3. Using another logo then the official police logo will confuse visitors and leave a less professional appearance.

<ul class="gallery" style="margin:0;">
<li class="gallery__item">
<a class="thumbnail" href="/images/documentation/branding-avatar.jpg" data-gallery="enabled" title="Police avatar">
<img src="/images/documentation/branding-avatar.jpg" />
</a>
</li>
</ul>

### Banners

For the social media banners we suggest to use the same image as the one used for the banner on your website.

1. Facebook banner: 851 x 315 pixels - see [facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/help/125379114252045) for more information.
2. Twitter banner: 1500 x 500 pixels - see [dev.twitter.com](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/user-profile-images-and-banners) for more information.
