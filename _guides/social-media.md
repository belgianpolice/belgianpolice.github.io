Social media is everywhere, it’s becoming more and more a part of how we live our lives today, and as government we can’t afford to miss the incredible opportunities it affords us.

This guide outlines how we suggest to use social media, what we’ve grown to understand as best practice and what we’ve learned.

## Accountability

Once you start using social media to talk to your community and spread your story, you become accountable. Social media is a two-way street. It makes no sense to use the channels to simply broadcast. You have to take part in the conversation, especially when people are asking you questions. If you don’t have the resource to answer enquiries, then you don’t have the resource to use the channel.

## Social customer service

We’re aware that government isn’t a brand, but providing a quick and effective service should be the goal for everyone. Keep in mind [32% of social customers expect a response within 30 minutes, with 42% expecting a response within 60 minutes](http://www.viralblog.com/social-media/social-media-and-customer-service/).

It’s important when considering customer service to ensure that you can receive direct messages from all users. Since this is a relatively new function, you have to switch it on yourself, and directions of how to do so can be found here.

## Tools

[Sprout Social](http://sproutsocial.com/) is a great tool to reach your audience across networks and promptly reply to questions. Sprout Social makes it easy for teams to keep tabs on conversations and effectively engage at all times.

[SocialBro](https://www.socialbro.com/) is a fantastic way of learning about your audience. When they’re online, the hashtags that they respond to, the links that they’re sharing and the things that they tweet about.

You can also learn about our community through Sprout Social, where you can see how many (if any) times that they’ve interacted with you and what age and gender they are.

## When and how to respond

Sometimes it’s difficult to know what kind of social interactions demand a response and, if they do, which kind of response is appropriate.

We suggest to always try and respond to @messages on Twitter – unless they’re just people name checking you. That response doesn’t always have to be public, if someone says something nice or smart about you, a favourite does the job of telling them that you liked it, without having to send thanks @messages all day long.

## Dealing with detractors

It is unfortunately a fact that, as soon as you become active on social media, there are going to be people who aren’t happy about it. These aren’t to be confused with people who have valid complaints or questions. Instead, they are people who continually talk about your account in a derogatory fashion for no good reason.

There are a number of ways to deal with these people.

Firstly create a “Rules of Conduct” for your Facebook page ([Converse](https://www.facebook.com/notes/converse/house-rules/330730391922) have a great example of this) – this isn’t quite as easy for a Twitter account, although you can host the rules elsewhere.

For example, when dealing with detractors on we suggest to try to help on the first message. If this person continues to tweet 5 or more times without engaging with your offer of help, you can block them.

## Escalation policy

If things do begin to get out of hand – an up to date escalation document is a really helpful tool to manage the “crisis”. Social bakers have just [blogged about theirs](http://www.socialbakers.com/blog/2100-5-things-you-must-have-in-your-social-media-crisis-plan).

## What are our key performance indicators (KPIs)?

- user growth
- engagement
- amplification (RTs)
- clicks
- favourites
- how long it takes us to answer tweets

Alongside tracking the number of users that follow you, also keep an eye on the number that unfollow you. (SocialBro offers this information in their [follower retention report](http://www.socialbro.com/userguide/analyzing-understanding-follower-retention-report).)  Over time you can create a baseline metric from the numbers, which allows you to see if certain times of the week/day/pieces of content create more unfollows.

You are, of course, interested in growing our community; but you should be more interested in ensuring our existing community are listened to, and that the content that you're providing is engaging and helpful.

## Social media and storytelling

For brands, social media is all about crafting a story for your fans and advocates to buy into, thus (hopefully) ensuring increased sales and loyalty. For government it’s a little bit different in that we’re not selling anything, or asking people to give us anything; in fact, in many cases our “users” have no choice but to interact with us.

However, you want your users to understand what you’re doing, and why you’re doing it as well as asking them for feedback. So your storytelling must be focussed on transparency.

Creating news is an incredibly important way that you can share stories. We encourage you to write news on your site and share it on your social media channels.

## Getting Verified on Twitter

When communicating with people on Twitter it’s important that they can trust that you’re the official voice of your department. One of the easiest ways to do this is to ensure your account is verified (you can identify verified accounts by the blue tick on their profile). Details on how to do this can be found on the [Twitter site](https://support.twitter.com/articles/119135-faqs-about-verified-accounts).

## General profile hygiene

Make sure your profiles are all filled out and kept updated.

Make sure your image pics and backgrounds are consistent. Check our [Digital Identiy](/guides/digital-identity) guide on this matter.
