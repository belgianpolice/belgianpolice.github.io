We are very happy to inform you that one year after the demo of the new internet platform the first website, [Politie Leuven](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5388), has been released a few days ago.

Over the past year we have heavily improved the platform. Most importantly, we have rebuilt the template from the ground up and rethought the information architecture using a "Mobile First" approach.

Aim of the new template is to provide the best user experience for citizens, whatever their device. The new web platform is a major step towards providing easy to find information. Featuring easy access to: district officers, contact information, frequently asked questions, traffic information.

> "With the increase in popularity of mobile devices, it is important to provide all new and prospective information in the format that is right for the citizen, whatever their device. The new platform is the beginning of this process as we aim to improve our services online." - Marc Alen, Coach ICT (VCLP/CPPL)

We are thrilled with the positive feedback we received in the past days. Because the new platform features a complete new information architecture an overnight migration of your existing website is not possible.

The new information architecture requires a complete re-development of each site content, adding streets, FAQ’s, local police officers, contact information and reworking the existing content. Sites cannot be migrated automatically.

Initially we’d start rolling-out new sites zone by zone, working closely with each zone and then evaluate how we go from there. The next site will be Police de Comines-Warneton, also the first french site. Simultaneous we are working on stabilising the new platform, and of course maintaining the current platform.
