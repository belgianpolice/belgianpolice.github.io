We are happy to inform you that we released the second website on the new platform last week, [Police Comines-Warneton](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5318).

Since the initial release of the Belgian Police Internet Platform, with the website of [Politie Leuven](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5388), six weeks ago we have closed down more then 20 development tickets resulting in our first maintenance release (v2.1).

This release include a mix of bug fixes and improvements, check the [release notes](https://github.com/belgianpolice/internet-platform/releases/tag/v2.1) for more information.

The new web platform is a major step towards providing easy to find information whatever device (desktop/tablet/mobile) a visitor is using. Featuring easy access to: district officers, contact information, frequently asked questions, traffic information.
