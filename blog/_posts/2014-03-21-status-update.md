Since the initial release of [Politie Leuven](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5388) last September we have closed down 3 releases ([v2.1](https://github.com/belgianpolice/internet-platform/releases/tag/v2.1), [v2.2](https://github.com/belgianpolice/internet-platform/releases/tag/v2.2) & [v2.3](https://github.com/belgianpolice/internet-platform/releases/tag/v2.3)), resulting in more then 100 closed development tickets. These releases include a mix of bug fixes and improvements (look & feel, speed performance, accessibility, ...).

A few of the most important changes:

## Rollout

All pilot zones have received dedicated training and access to their new website, including the zones who are part of our development community. One of those, [Politie Damme/Knokke-Heist](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5446) has released their website a few weeks ago.

Our next step (phase 2) will be targeted towards all the zones who are a member of the VCLP-CPPL. In just two weeks we will host a training session for these webmasters.

We are aiming to start phase 3 in June for the next group of 20 zones. If everything keeps running smoothly we will organise a training for 20 zones every 10 weeks.

Because the new platform features a complete new information architecture an overnight migration of your existing website is not possible. The new information architecture requires a complete re-development of each site content, adding streets, FAQâ€™s, local police officers, contact information and reworking the existing content.

We will therefor kindly ask all participating zones to make the necessary resources available to complete the migration in 10 weeks so we can start with another group.
