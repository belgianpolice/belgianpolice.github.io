The objective of the Belgian Police Internet Platform is to provide all new and prospective information in the format that is right for our users, whatever their device. The new platform that is currently in rollout is the beginning of this process as we aim to improve our digital services.

Here’s a graph showing how the devices people use to visit the website of their Police zone have changed. To be precise, the data is for visits collected across the 110 Police zones, Belgium counts 194 police zones, who are using v1 or v2 of the Belgian Police Internet Platform.

In the first quarter of 2014, 75% of visits have come from a desktop computer, 15% from a mobile and 10% from a tablet. In the first quarter of 2012 it was 95% desktop computer, 3% mobile and 2% tablet.

Shifts in the devices people use to access the internet should come as no surprise, but the pace of change might. And I do not expect this switch away from desktop computers towards more personal, portable, touchscreen devices to slow down anytime soon.

## Mobile First
Designing for small screens can be a real challenge. Which is why we have rebuilt the template from the ground up and rethought the information architecture using a “Mobile First” approach.

Why? Simply, it’s often easier to make a website also work for a desktop monitor and keyboard if you’ve already made it work really well on a small touchscreen than it is to go the other way.
