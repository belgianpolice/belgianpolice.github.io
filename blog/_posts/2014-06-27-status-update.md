Since our [previous status update](http://belgianpolice.github.io/blog/2014/03/21/status-update.html), just over 3 months ago,
we have closed down 2 releases ([v2.4](https://github.com/belgianpolice/internet-platform/releases/tag/v2.4) & [v2.5](https://github.com/belgianpolice/internet-platform/releases/tag/v2.5)) resulting in more then 80 closed development tickets.
These releases include a mix of bug fixes and new features.

A few of the most important changes:

* Added Press<sup>*</sup> component, see [Politie MidLim](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5888/pers)
* Added BIN/RIQ<sup>*</sup> component, <a href="{{site.url}}/images/blog/2014/2014-06-27/bin.png" data-gallery="enabled">see screenshot</a>
* Added 'note' field and 'appointment only' to office hours in Contacts, <a href="{{site.url}}/images/blog/2014/2014-06-27/office-hours.png" data-gallery="enabled">see screenshot</a>

<sup>*</sup> Optional - create a support ticket to enable it for your site.

## Rollout
Over the past three months we have also organised two training sessions (April & June) resulting in 50 police zones who have access to the new platform. Two of those, [Politie MidLim](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5888) and [Police Mouscron](http://www.policelocale.be/5317) have released their new website a few weeks ago.

We are very happy that 9 months after the initial release of the new platform 25% of all police zones have received training and started migrating their website to the new platform.

Planning for the next training sessions in September and November has already started.
Create a support ticket or [drop us an email](mailto:belgianpolice@gmail.com) if you want to join one of the upcoming training sessions.
