Even during the summer we keep the pace high. Another [release](https://github.com/belgianpolice/internet-platform/releases/tag/v2.6) with a mix of bug fixes and new features has just been closed. We have also added [guides](/guides/) to help you write good content for the web.

A few of the most important changes:

* Finalised multi-lingual support
* Automated CRAB synchronisation (weekly)
* Better handling of large images
* Now the domain name matches the site's language

A complete changelog can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/belgianpolice/internet-platform/releases/tag/v2.6).

## Guides
Our newly added [guides](/guides/) are a valuable resource for anyone involved in creating content for the web. They will help you make all content accessible, readable and understandable:

* [Content styles](/guides/content-styles.html)
* [Digital identity](/guides/digital-identity.html)
* [Social media](/guides/social-media.html)
* [Writing for the web](/guides/writing-for-the-web.html)

We specifically wanna thank the [Government Digital Service team](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/) of GOV.UK for providing an awesome public [style guide](https://www.gov.uk/design-principles/style-guide) and [social media playbook](https://gdssocialmedia.blog.gov.uk/playbook/#the-case-for-social-media).
