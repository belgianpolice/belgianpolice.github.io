You can now schedule news articles to automatically publish themselves at any time in the future.

## Schedule an article

In the Publish module to the right of the article editor, leave the 'Published' checkbox blank and click 'Publish on'.
Now select the future date and time when you want the article to publish itself.

## Un-scheduling an article

If youâ€™ve scheduled an article to be published in the future, but changed your mind and want to publish it immediately, head back to the article editor.

In the Publish module, remove the 'Publish on' date and mark the article as 'Published'.
