As you probably already know, we are a huge fan of [Open Data](https://okfn.org/opendata/). Therefor we now update the streets in your site weekly, on wednesday evening, using the [CRAB database](https://www.agiv.be/producten/crab) provided by the [AGIV](https://www.agiv.be/).

Whenever a street is added or changed in the CRAB database (by the city) these changes will be available in your site within a week. More information about the CRAB validation process by the cities in Flanders can be found on [www.agiv.be](https://www.agiv.be/news/2014/juni/crab-validatie-op-kruissnelheid).

Next step is to get in touch with [GÃ©oportail de la Wallonie](http://geoportail.wallonie.be/) & [CIBG Brussels](http://www.cibg.irisnet.be/) if they can help us to further optimise our streets database using Open Data.

## Streets in your site

You can verify if all your streets are attached to a district officer by navigating to **Tools > Streets** in your administrator interface and filter for **No District Officer**.
Or sort the table based on the **Created on** column to verify when a new street has been added.
