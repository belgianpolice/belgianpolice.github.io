## Rollout
Over the past seven months we have organised three training sessions (April, June & September) resulting in more then 70 Police zones who have access to the new platform.

Since our [previous update](http://www.openpolice.be/blog/2014/09/01/summer-update.html) 7 more zones have released their new website:

- [Police De Wavre](http://www.policelocale.be/5271)
- [Police Mons-Qu√©vy](http://www.policelocale.be/5324)
- [Politie Heusden-Zolder](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5375)
- [Politie AMOW](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5408)
- [Politie Erpe-Mere/Lede](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5441)
- [Politie Dendermonde](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5443)
- [Politie Oostende](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5449)

This brings the total to 19 zones using the new platform in production and another 50 zones who are currently working on the migration.

Planning for the next training on Thursday 5 December in Diest has already started. Create a support ticket or [drop us an email](mailto:belgianpolice@gmail.com) if you want to join.
