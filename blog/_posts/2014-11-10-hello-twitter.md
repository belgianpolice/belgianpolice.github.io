You can now follow us on [Twitter (@openpoliceBE)](https://www.twitter.com/openpoliceBE) if you want to stay up to date about the development and iterations of the Open Police platform.

Our [Twitter account](https://www.twitter.com/openpoliceBE) is a next step in making the Open Police platform even more open.

## Why open matters

We strongly believe that an open development model is the only way to foster badly-needed government standards, remove the fear of proprietary lock-in for government agencies, and create a large ecosystem that spans the government as a whole.

All of our code is freely available under an open source license. Anyone can run it, build on it, or submit changes to it.

## Community

Alongside the actual development of the project, we also actively work to encourage this new approach to architecture across Belgian Local Police departments.

One of the ways this is done is by building and maintaining an active and open community of developers. Anyone should be able to contribute to the architecture, both inside and outside of the Police boundaries.

All the source code for the project is hosted on a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/belgianpolice) which allows other developers to learn from, re-use and contribute to the development of the platform.

Check our [About](/about/) page if you wanna discover more.
