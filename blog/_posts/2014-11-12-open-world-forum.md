We were honoured to give a [talk](http://www.openworldforum.paris/en/speakers/johan-janssens/) at the [Open World Forum](http://www.openworldforum.paris/en/) in Paris on Friday 31 October. Open World Forum explored Open Source, Open Hardware, Open Data and the Open Web with the world's top technical, business and thought leaders, and the most vibrant communities, for two days.

## A unique event

The Open World Forum is the first European summit to gather political representatives, decision-makers and experts, in one place, in order to debate the technological, economic and social impacts that the Free and Open-Source technologies bring to market. The forum was first held in 2008, and is now organized annually in Paris, France, with more than 200 speakers coming from 40 countries, and a global audience that was 2200-people strong in 2013.

## Look inside

In his talk [Johan Janssens](https://twitter.com/johanjanssens), project lead, gave a look inside the platform and the latest and greatest open source tools, libraries and technologies we are using, like Flexbox, Pagespeed, Git, Vagrant, Capistrano, PHP, Elasticsearch, ... .

Johan showed how the platform is being developed [openly on GitHub](https://github.com/belgianpolice) and explained the complete design pipeline from initial feature idea, through local development, to online testing and finally deployment into production.
