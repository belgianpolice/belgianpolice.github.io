During the training session last week we promised to extend the office hours functionality in time for the holiday season.
You can now override the weekly office hours by adding **'one-off'** office hours on a specific date.

Adding different office hours for a holiday is very easy. Until today you could only select a weekday when creating new office hours.
Now you can set the frequency to **'one-off'** and specify the date.

We have updated the [documentation]({{site.url}}/documentation/06-contacts.html#manage-office-hours) the reflect this new functionality. Do not hesitate to create a [support ticket]({{site.url}}/documentation/09-support.html) in your administrator area if you have questions.
