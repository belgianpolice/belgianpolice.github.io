We have just closed down a new release ([v2.8](https://github.com/belgianpolice/internet-platform/releases/tag/v2.8)).
Resulting in more then 40 closed development tickets since our [previous release]({{site.url}}/blog/2014/11/04/status-update.html) less then 2 months ago. The release include a mix of bug fixes and enhancements.

## Major Enhancements

### Holiday office hours

You can now override the weekly office hours by adding **‘one-off’** office hours on a specific date. This functionality comes just in time for the holiday season. Visitors can now also browse the office hours for the upcoming 14 days.

We have updated the [documentation]({{site.url}}/documentation/06-contacts.html#manage-office-hours) to reflect this new functionality.

### Safety check results

You can now add results to roadside safety checks.

We have updated the [documentation]({{site.url}}/documentation/04-traffic.html#add-results) to reflect this new functionality.

### District officer & Neighbourhood

We have combined 'Your district officer' and 'Neighbourhood Information Network' into one page.

No website is using the **Neighbourhood Information Network** functionality yet, but we made a <a href="{{site.url}}/images/blog/2014/your-district.png" data-gallery="enabled">screenshot</a> of the result.

### Redesigned attachments listing

We redesigned the attachments listing, examples: [Documents](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5376/over-ons/jaarverslag) & [Image gallery](http://www.policelocale.be/5318/a-propos/gallerie-photos/police-day-2014).

### Analytics dashboard

A simple Analytics dashboard is now available in your administrator area, you can find it in 'Tools > Analytics'.

## Rollout
Over the past nine months we have organised four training sessions (April, June, September & December) resulting in 99 Police zones who have access to the new platform.

Since our [previous update](http://www.openpolice.be/blog/2014/11/04/status-update.html) 8 more zones have released their new website:

* [Police Condroz-Famenne](http://www.policelocale.be/5314)
* [Police Haute Senne](http://www.policelocale.be/5328)
* [Police Orneau-Mehaigne](http://www.policelocale.be/5304)
* [Police Seraing-Neupré](http://www.policelocale.be/5278)
* [Politie Meetjesland](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5417)
* [Politie Ninove](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5442)
* [Politie Sint-Truiden - Gingelom - Nieuwerkerken](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5376)
* [Politie Ronse](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5427)

This brings the total to 27 zones using the new platform in production and another 72 zones who are working on the migration.
