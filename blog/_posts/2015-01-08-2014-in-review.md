The last 12 months have yielded a tapestry of highs, 25 websites got released on the new platform and 301 development ticket got closed spread over 7 releases.

As another year has already started, let's have a look back at what brought us here.

## Rollout

Over the past year we trained 99 police zones spread over 4 training sessions (April, June, September & December).

We raised the total to [27 zones]({{site.url}}/sites.html) using the new internet platform and another 72 zones who are working on migrating their existing website.

## Releases

We closed [7 releases](https://github.com/belgianpolice/internet-platform/releases), resulting in 301 closed development tickets. These releases included a mix of bug fixes, enhancements and new features.

Some of the most important new features:

* [Streets based on Open Data](http://www.openpolice.be/blog/2014/09/12/streets-database.html)
* [Holiday office hours](http://www.openpolice.be/blog/2014/12/12/holiday-office-hours.html)
* [Roadside safety check results](http://www.openpolice.be/documentation/05-traffic.html#add-results)
* [Combined District officer & Neighbourhood network](http://www.openpolice.be/blog/2014/12/23/status-update.html#district-officer--neighbourhood)
* [Schedule a news article](http://www.openpolice.be/blog/2014/09/10/schedule-a-news-article.html)
* [Press articles](http://www.openpolice.be/documentation/03-press.html)

We have also added [guides](http://www.openpolice.be/guides/) to help you make all content accessible, readable
and understandable. Moved our website to [www.openpolice.be](http://www.openpolice.be) and created our [@OpenPoliceBE](https://twitter.com/openpoliceBE) Twitter account.

## Analytics

We topped off 2014 with a total of **3.647.956 visitors** (22,5% more then 2013) spread over 118 police zones, or one visitor every 17 minutes on every website.

Earlier this year we blogged about [the rise of mobile](http://www.openpolice.be/blog/2014/05/31/the-rise-of-mobile.html).
In just 2 years the percentage of mobile visitors almost tripled from 13% in December 2012 to 34% in December 2014.

With the increase in popularity of mobile devices, it is important to provide all new and prospective information in the format that is right for the citizen, whatever their device.

We were thrilled with the positive feedback we received in the past year and are looking forward to further improve the platform.
We started 2015 by opening up our [development tickets](https://github.com/belgianpolice/internet-platform/issues), check what we are doing, while we are doing it.
