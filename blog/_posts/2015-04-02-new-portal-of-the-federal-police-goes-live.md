We are very happy to inform you that the new website of the Federal Police went live earlier this week on our platform.
At the same time we have also released a new landing page for the integrated police.

With the migration of the [Federal Police website](http://www.politie.be/fed/nl) 125 police websites are now using our open government platform for their public communication.

The new [Federal Police website](http://www.politie.be/fed/nl) uses the same set of features that were developed specifically for the Local Police.
The most notable addition is a specific component to publish missing and wanted persons.

## New portal for the integrated police

The Belgian Police is structured on two levels: the Federal Police and the Local Police. The Local Police is divided into 192 Police zones.

The new [portal of the integrated police](http://www.politie.be/intro) makes it easier for users to find the information they are looking for. The new portal provides easy access, among others, to:

- the websites of the 192 Local Police zones
- the website of the Federal Police
- the most recent missing and wanted persons

## Every day, we work to improve

The release of the new [Federal Police website](http://www.politie.be/fed/nl) and [portal of the integrated police](http://www.politie.be/intro) is just another step in our continual work to better serve the needs of our users.

Our best feature is nothing weâ€™ve built so far. It's our never ending commitment to continuous improvement.
