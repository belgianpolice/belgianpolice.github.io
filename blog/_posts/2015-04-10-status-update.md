Earlier this week we have closed a new release ([v2.9](https://github.com/belgianpolice/internet-platform/releases/tag/v2.9)).
Resulting in 80 closed development tickets since our [previous release]({{site.url}}/blog/2014/12/23/status-update.html) at the end of 2014.
The release includes a redesigned portal for the integrated police and the migration of the Federal Police. Together with a mix of bug fixes and enhancements.

## Major Enhancements

### Embed Youtube

You can now embed a youtube video in news, about and questions by pasting the URL of a video in the provided input field.

An example can be found on the website of [Politie Leuven](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5388/over-ons/werken-bij-de-politie).

### Found items

We have developed a basic component to publish found items. An example can be found on the website of [Politie Oostende](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5449/gevonden-voorwerpen).

Currently, the found component is optional. Create a support ticket to have it enabled for your website.

### New portal for the integrated police

The new [portal of the integrated police](http://www.politie.be/intro) makes it easier for users to find the information they are looking for. The new portal provides easy access, among others, to:

- the websites of the 192 Local Police zones
- the website of the Federal Police
- the most recent missing and wanted persons

### New Federal Police website

As announced [a few days ago]({{site.url}}/blog/2015/04/02/new-portal-of-the-federal-police-goes-live.html) the Federal Police migrated to our platform.
The new [Federal Police website](http://www.politie.be/fed/nl) uses the same set of features that were developed specifically for the Local Police.
The most notable addition is a specific component to publish missing and wanted persons.

## Rollout
Last year we have organised four training sessions (April, June, September & December) resulting in 99 police zones who have access to the new platform.
The next training will be planned at the end of May for the remaining 34 zones that are currently using the old version of the platform.

Since our [previous update](http://www.openpolice.be/blog/2014/11/04/status-update.html) another 15 websites have released:

* [Federale Politie](http://www.politie.be/fed/nl)
* [Police Hesbaye-Ouest](http://www.policelocale.be/5293)
* [Police Famenne-Ardenne](http://www.policelocale.be/5300)
* [Police Des Trieux](http://www.policelocale.be/5336)
* [Politie Ukkel/WB/Oudergem](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5342)
* [Politie Balen-Dessel-Mol](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5368)
* [Politie Neteland](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5369)
* [Politie West-Limburg](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5374)
* [Politie Noordoost-Limburg](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5385)
* [Politie HerKo](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5393)
* [Politie Aalter-Knesselare](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5423)
* [Politie Sint-Niklaas](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5432)
* [Politie Blankenberge/Zuienkerke](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5445)
* [Politie MIRA](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5457)
* [Politie Waasland-Noord](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/5904)

This brings the total to 41 Local Police zones and the Federal Police using the new platform in production.
