Last week federal minister of the digital agenda, Alexander De Croo and his Digital Minds advisory board announced the action plan "Digital Belgium". We join hands to help shape our digital future, together.

**[Digital Belgium](http://www.digitalbelgium.be/en)** outlines the digital long-term vision for Belgium and translates this into clear ambitions. On the basis of five clear, specific priorities we would like to put Belgium more firmly on the digital map.

## Action plan

* **Digital Confidence And Digital Security**, only when citizens and businesses have full confidence that their data is safe online, can the digital economy achieve its full potential.
* **Digital Economy**, digitalisation encourages people to be entrepreneurial and brings new players into the field.
* **Digital Government**, both citizens and businesses need to be able to conduct all communication with the government digitally by 2020 and to be able to do so using a user-friendly channel.
* **Digital Infrastructure**, investment into digital infrastructure is necessary so that the digital economy can continue to grow.
* **Digital Skills And Jobs**, governments need to monitor that as many citizens as possible, irrespective of their age and background, are able to take advantage of the necessary digital opportunities.

> In order to be successful in this, it's all about working together and sharing know-how. Because tomorrow's network economy cannot be entrapped in yesterday's structures. "Digital Belgium" is not just a vision and a plan, but it's also an invitation to join hands and together to shape our digital future. - [Alexander De Croo](https://twitter.com/alexanderdecroo)

## We join hands


We, <a href="http://www.timble.net">Timble</a>, strongly believe that an **open development model** is the only way to foster badly-needed government standards, remove the fear of proprietary lock-in for government agencies, and create a large ecosystem that spans the government as a whole.

Therefore, all of the code of our **open government platform** for the **Belgian Police** is freely available under an open source license on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/belgianpolice). Anyone can run it, build on it, or submit changes to it.

The Police Web Platform is the first Belgian government project that uses an **'open everything'** approach. Setting a benchmark in how governments can innovate using **open source** and **open standards**.
