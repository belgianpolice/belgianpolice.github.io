            <h1>Police Web Platform</h1>
            <p>The Police Web Platform is an open-source platform specifically built for the internet websites of the Belgian Police.
                It uses a component based architecture. Written in PHP, HTML, CSS and Javascript, and made by <a href="http://www.timble.net">passionate open source technologists</a>.</p>
            <p>Fork our <a href="http://github.com/belgianpolice/internet-platform">code on GitHub</a> and check a short <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/timble/belgian-police-web-platform">presentation on Speaker Deck</a>.</p>

            <h2>Why open matters</h2>
            <p>We strongly believe that an open development model is the only way to foster badly-needed government standards, remove the fear of proprietary lock-in for government agencies, and create a large ecosystem that spans the government as a whole.</p>
            <p>All of our code is freely available under an open source license. Anyone can <strong>run it</strong>, <strong>build on it</strong>, or <strong>submit changes</strong> to it.</p>
