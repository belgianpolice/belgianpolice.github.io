<h1>Belgian Police CSS Styleguide</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Belgian Police CSS Styleguide. Before reading this, you should have a general understanding for specificity,
the <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SCSS</a> syntax, and <a href="https://github.com/kneath/kss">KSS</a> documentation.</p>

<p>If you're visiting from the internet, feel free to learn from our style. This is a guide we use for our own apps
internally at GitHub. We encourage you to set up one that works for your own team.</p>
